## 🧠 Testing Methodology

My testing approach is built on industry best practices:

- ✅ Requirement Analysis - Understanding acceptance criteria and user stories
- ✅ Test Design - Positive, negative, and boundary scenario coverage
- ✅ Risk-Based Prioritization - Focus on high-impact areas first
- ✅ Defect Classification - Severity and priority-based bug reporting
- ✅ Structured Documentation - Clear, reproducible test cases and bug reports
- ✅ Regression Validation - Ensuring fixes don't introduce new issues

I focus on identifying functional gaps, validation weaknesses, usability issues, and data inconsistencies early in the development lifecycle to reduce costs and improve product quality.

## 📊 Featured QA Project

### 🧾 Employee Form — Comprehensive Manual Testing
Objective: End-to-end quality validation of an employee management form application
Project Scope:

- Personal Information Module
- Contact & ID Validation
- Employment Information
- Dropdown Controls
- Form Validation & Error Handling
- UI/UX Consistency
- Data Integrity & Loss Prevention

Testing Results:

- ✅ 32 Test Cases designed and executed
- 🐞 47 Defects identified and documented
- 🔴 Critical Issues: 12 (data loss, security concerns)
- 🟠 High Priority: 16 (validation failures, incorrect calculations)
- 🟡 Medium Priority: 10 (UI inconsistencies)
- 🟢 Low Priority: 9 (cosmetic issues)

Key Findings:

- NIC field accepts invalid special characters
- Age calculation incorrect (DOB: 18/11/2020 shows Age 3 instead of 5)
- Employee ID generation doesn't follow specification format
- Contact number validation missing (accepts <10 digits and special chars)
- Email validation not enforced (accepts incomplete emails)
- Future dates allowed in Date of Birth and Date Joined fields
- Form submission fails with generic error instead of field-level validation

Deliverables:

- Detailed Test Plan with scope and approach
- 32 Test Cases with preconditions, steps, and expected results
- 47 Bug Reports with severity, priority, and reproduction steps
- Test Summary Report with recommendations
- Visual evidence (screenshots) for critical defects
