# 🕵️‍♂️ Tilesha Madulantha — QA Portfolio

Welcome to my Software Quality Assurance portfolio.

I am an aspiring QA Engineer with a background in Software Engineering and IT Support, focused on structured manual testing, defect analysis, and validation processes.

This repository showcases practical QA work including full test cycles, defect documentation, test planning, execution reporting, API validation, and SQL-based data verification.

## 🎯 Target Role
QA Intern / Junior QA Engineer

---

## 🎓 Education
- B.Sc. (Hons) in Software Engineering — University of Plymouth (2025)
- Information Technology — NIBM
- NVQ Level 4 in Graphic Design — NAITA

## 🧠 Testing Approach

My testing methodology is based on:

- Requirement-based test design
- Positive / Negative / Boundary scenario coverage
- Risk-based prioritization
- Severity & Priority classification
- Structured defect documentation
- Regression validation before release

I focus on identifying functional gaps, validation weaknesses, usability issues, and potential data inconsistencies early in the development lifecycle.
